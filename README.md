## Python
Python is an object-oriented language 

## Output
Output is the way the computer printys information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the complier skips over 

To use comments, we use `# COMMENT` for single-line 

We use `''' COMMENT'''` for block comments 

## Data Types
We will be working with 5 main data types

1. Interger (int) - whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False 1= True 0= False
 ## Variables
 Variables are containers that hold a value 
 ### Rules for variable names
 1. Always start with a letter 
 `1name = "Celine" ` --> NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores ( _ )
3. If more than one word, use ccamelCase or underscores to separate words 
`myFirstName` or `myfirst_name`


## Concatenation 
`+` Adding strings together, appen ding (add to end) 
`"Hello " + "World" = " Hello World"`

## Type Cast
Forcing a data type on a value 

### To force an interger into a string 
`str(veriabbleName)`

### To force a string into an interger 
`int(variableName)`
